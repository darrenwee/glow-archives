	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLt #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLt #sidebar1 {
	float: left; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsLt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.

 	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */

    <h1 class="maintext">All about Newcastle</h1>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Below you will find an overview of the city of Newcastle and the surrounding area. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">For further information about Newcastle visit the VisitNewcastleGateshead site or explore some of the links at the bottom of this page.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext"><a

    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext">Newcastle upon Tyne: the city </h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Newcastle upon Tyne is in the heart of the Geordie-speaking North East of England.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Despite its busy urban atmosphere, Newcastle is also a city of open spaces, with numerous parks; Exhibition park and Leazes park are adjacent to the University, and the Town Moor is a large moorland park where the Hoppings, Europe's largest travelling fair, takes place each June. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Newcastle is an historic city of impressive architectural grandeur. The Norman castle, after which the city was named, the medieval cathedral (St. Nicholas) with its lantern tower and other historic churches stand alongside the nineteenth-century elegance of Grey Street - described by John Betjeman as 'the most imposing facade in Western Europe'. The Quayside area by the River Tyne has been developed in recent years into a modern centre incorporating hotels, restaurants, leisure facilities, executive flats, the new law courts, and on the Gateshead side the splendid BALTIC centre for contemporary art. There are numerous bridges across the River Tyne, the best known being the Tyne Bridge which has not only become a symbol of the city but was also the prototype for the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The impressive new millenium bridge (shown above) is a must see! </p>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Newcastle is the centre of one of the most naturally-beautiful and historically-rich 
      parts of England. Northumbria is steeped in the history of violent clashes with 
      invading Scots and marauding Vikings and, in addition to the relics of the Roman 
      occupation almost 2,000 years ago, including Hadrian's Wall, there are many 
      castles, some of which are still occupied. The most famous of these are Alnwick, 
      Warkworth, Dunstanburgh and Bamburgh overlooking the rugged North Sea coast. 
      The hills, moors and dales of the Northumberland National Park draw those who 
      seek the beauty of peaceful, unspoilt countryside. Holy Island and the Farne 
      Islands, famous for their beauty and wildlife, offer a popular day out. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext">Places of Interest</h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">The following places are particularly popular with tourists, all accessible on local public transport. Newcastle is only 1hr20mins on the train to Edinburgh and 55 minutes to York, ideally located for day trips.</p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext">Within 30 minutes of Newcastle:</h4>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext"><strong><b>Durham Castle &amp; Cathedral</b></strong></h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">The stately Castle of the bishops was founded by the Conqueror in 1072 and was originally a system of defensive earthworks of the 'motte-and-bailey' type. Eventually the Castle's military functions ceased and successive Prince Bishops resided there, restoring and modifying it into the impressive building it is today. Now, with the Cathedral, it is a World Heritage Site. The building of the Cathedral dates from the 11th century. It is considered by many to be the world's finest Norman cathedral. The whole church was designed to be vaulted, and the ribbed vault of the north choir-aisle (before 1096) is the oldest in England; the main choir vault was renewed early in the 13C. The Galilee was added as a Lady Chapel by Bishop Puiset (1153-95). Dr Johnson described the Cathedral as one of &quot;rocky solidity and indeterminate duration&quot;. Visitors are also able to see the Bede Altar and the Shrine of St Cuthbert. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext"><strong><b>Hadrian's Wall</b></strong></h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Built under the governorship of Aulus Platorius Nepos (ad 122-126) after the evacuation of Inchtuthil on the Tay and the abandonment of Scotland beyond the Tay, the Wall forms a zone of fortification extending across England for 73.5 miles. It was patrolled from so-called 'milecastles' (c. 1620 yds apart), between which were smaller turrets at every 540 yrds, and was garrisoned by infantry and cavalry in 17 large forts. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext"><b class="maintext">Tynemouth Priory &amp; Castle</b></h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">The prominent headland at the entrance to the Tyne estuary has for centuries been strategically important. The Priory was once one of the richest in all England, with a presbytery 22 metres high, whose soaring arches still impress. At the east end of the church is the Percy Chantry with its wonderful interlaced rib-vault design. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext"><strong>Beamish Museum </strong></h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">An open air museum, it vividly recreates life in the North of England in the early 1800s and 1900s. Costumed staff welcome visitors to the turn of the century Town with shops, houses, working pub, newspaper office, garage, sweetshop and sweets factory. Guided tours are given underground at a real &quot;drift&quot; mine in the Colliery Village and a row of pit cottages shows how the pitman and their families lived. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext"><b>National Glass Centre, Sunderland</b> </h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">Sunderland is renowned as the birthplace of stained glassmaking in Britain. It was introduced in the 7th century by the Christian scholar Benedict Biscop, who brought craftsmen from France to create stained glass windows for St Peters Church, Monkwearmouth. The industry has been a part of Sunderland's heritage every since. You can see a range of exhibitions at the centre as well as demonstrations of hot glass blowing and stained glass making. </p>
    <h4 align="justify" class="maintext">Restaurants, Pubs and Clubs </h4>
    <p align="justify" class="maintext">With many restaurants in the city, you can sample cuisine from around the world, as well as enjoying vegetarian food, traditional fare and local specialities. Happy Hours mean that you can often eat at half price. Traditional English pubs are still very much in evidence, particularly on the Quayside, and there are also many smart new wine bars and restaurants especially in the Jesmond area (metro stop 'Jesmond' or 'West Jesmond'). The city has numerous night clubs, one of which is located on the liner moored beneath the Tyne Bridge. A list of restaurants in Newcastle city centre will be available in the delegate pack. </p>
